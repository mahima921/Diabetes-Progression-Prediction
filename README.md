#This project uses the Diabetes dataset from sklearn.datasets to predict the progression of diabetes based on 10 clinical features. It demonstrates end-to-end supervised machine learning using regression techniques.

ðŸ”Ž Key Steps

#Data Exploration: Feature distributions, correlation heatmap, scatter plots

#Preprocessing: Train-test split, scaling with StandardScaler

#Model Training:

#Linear Regression

#Ridge Regression (with CV for alpha tuning)

#Lasso Regression (with CV for alpha tuning)

#Evaluation:

#Mean Squared Error (MSE)

#Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

#RÂ² Score

#Model Comparison: Tabular + visualization of performance

#Feature Importance: Analysis of influential features using coefficients

ðŸ“Š ##Results

#Ridge/Lasso gave better stability than simple Linear Regression.

#Best model selected based on cross-validation RÂ² score.

#Top features influencing target: BMI, Blood Pressure, and S5 (serum measurements).

ðŸš€ ##Skills Gained

( LinearRegression)
#Data Preprocessing & EDA

#Model Selection & Hyperparameter Tuning

#Evaluation Metrics & Cross-Validation
